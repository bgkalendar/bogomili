/**
 * This is an abstraction of a Leto/Calendar period.<br/> 
 * <br/>
 * Each calendar splits the time into periods types with different granularity. 
 * Examples for periods are: day, month, year, century and so on.
 * These periods are defined as implementations of interface LetoPeriodType. 
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * Main problem for the calendar system to solve is to calculate a date from a given time point. 
 * The date that is generated is a representation that gives a value for each period type supported by the 
 * given calendar.<br/>
 *  
 * For example in date "2010 May 1", 
 * day period type has value: {@code 1}, month period type has value: {@code May} 
 * and year period type has value: {@code 2010}.
 * The value is usually a number (day, year). However in some cases there might exist a name that maps to 
 * the number value (name "May" maps to the value 5 for month).   
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * The interface LetoPeriod is the interface that declares the mapping between period types and actual values 
 * for a given date. Its main internal member variables are the period type and the actual value. 
 * So each date will consists of an array of LetoPeriod implementations - one for each period type.
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * If we take the example date above "2010 May 1", then this could be internally represented with the following
 * array of LetoPeriod implementations.
 * <pre><code>
 * 
 * </code></pre>

     *       <li>Month with 31 days</li>
